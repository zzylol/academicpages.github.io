I am a third-year PhD student advised by [Prof. Alan (Zaoxing) Liu](https://zaoxing.github.io/) at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/). I received my B.E. for Computer Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021. My research interests are broadly in systems and networking. In particular, I attempt to bridge the gap between approxiamte algorithms (e.g., sampling, sketches) and practical computing systems (e.g., graph systems, key-value store migration systems), aiming to improve query performance and system scalability. Currently, I'm working on sketch-based network performance monitoring and Cloud monitoring systems. 

<p>&#x1F60A; Feel free to drop me an email (zeyingz@umd.edu) if you are interested in my research.</p>
