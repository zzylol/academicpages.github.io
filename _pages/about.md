I am a PhD student working with Prof. Alan (Zaoxing) Liu at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/). I'm broadly interested in systems and networking. 


I received my BEng. for Computer Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021. 



Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in my research.
